# Workflow guide
------------

This document deals with the work's repartition between Lefort Tanguy, Gaizi Ibrahim and Coiffier Oph√©lie.
Our subjet is about fractals and in particular the link between the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map.

We divided the main work in three parts :

1. the 2D Mandelbrot set will be written by Gaizi Ibrahim,
2. written by Coiffier Ophelie, the definition of the map and its representation will be done with Lefort Tanguy for its animation and the creation of a widget,
3. the visual link between the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map will be written by all of us.

Once we've done this, we'll create the documentation using Sphinx and complete the `README.md` file.

As for the benchmarking, it will be done once everything is completed.
