# Workflow guide

This document deals with the work's repartition between Lefort Tanguy, Gaizi Ibrahim and Coiffier Oph√©lie.
Our subjet is about fractals and in particular the link between the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map.

We divided the main work in three parts :

1. the 2D Mandelbrot set will be written by Gaizi Ibrahim,
2. written by Coiffier Ophelie, the definition of the map and its representation will be done with Lefort Tanguy for its animation and the creation of a widget,
3. the visual link between the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map will be written by all of us.

Once we've done this, we'll create the documentation using Sphinx and complete the `README.md` file.

As for the benchmarking, it will be done once everything is completed. 

The schedule that we've predicted is :

- Mandlebrot 2D init is completed
- Mandlebrot 3D init is completed
- Class of Mandlebrot 2D : 1st April finished
- Class of Mandlebrot 3D : 26th April finished
- Logisitc init is completed
- Logistic push further : 26th April finished
- Report init will be finished 2nd May
- Beamer will be finished one week before due date (hopes) !!
- Test functions will be finished, the ones for 2D, before 10th April and others when we will need of them
- Sphinx is completed
- Report widgets will be done by 2nd May, properly
- Sparse matrix : 12th April finished
- Histogram : 26th April finished
- Animations : 26th April finished
