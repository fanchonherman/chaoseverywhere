# Workflow guide

This document deals with the work's repartition between Lefort Tanguy, Gaizi Ibrahim and Coiffier Oph√©lie.
Our subjet is about fractals and in particular the link between the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map.

We divided the main work in three parts :

1. the 2D Mandelbrot set will be written by Gaizi Ibrahim,
2. written by Coiffier Ophelie, the definition of the Logistic map and its representation will be done with Lefort Tanguy for its animation and the creation of a widget,
3. the visual link between the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map will be written by all of us.

Once we've done this, we'll create the documentation using Sphinx and complete the `README.md` file.

As for the benchmarking, it will be done once everything is completed. 

The schedule that we've predicted is :

- Mandlebrot 2D init is completed since at least April 25
- Mandlebrot 3D init is completed since at least April 25
- Class of Mandlebrot 2D is completed since at least April 25
- Class of Mandlebrot 3D (included in Class of Mandlebrot 2D) is completed since at least April 25
- Logisitc init is completed since at least April 25
- Logistic push further : April 26 finished
- Report init will be finished May 2
- Beamer will be finished one week before due date (hopes) !!
- Test functions will be finished, the ones for 2D, before April 10 and others when we will need of them
- Sphinx is completed since at least April 25
- Report widgets : April 28 finished
- Sparse matrix : April 12 finished
- Histogram : April 26 finished
- Animations : April 26 finished
